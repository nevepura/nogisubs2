00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Do you know about Nogizaka46 Talk App?

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,420
Oh, I'm late to introduce you.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,900
I'm Iroha Okuda.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,100
If you pay 350 yen per month,

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,040
There is a wonderful service that delivers photos, videos, and voices from the members.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,740
In this video, I'm eating in the talk app.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,300
I'm sending you a picture of me eating.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,980
That was the popularity.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,400
It turned out to be a YouTube project.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,840
From now on, I will deliver it as usual.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,060
I would be happy if you could take a look at it.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,200
Then please.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,040
Hello, I'm Iroha.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,320
Today, I came to a Thai restaurant.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,820
The interior of the store is colorful and cute.

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,060
I can't see much from this seat.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,060
What I've prepared for this shoot is...

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,940
I'm very hungry.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,360
I came here without eating breakfast.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,360
I chose this restaurant because I was worried about the menu.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,700
The timing to call the staff is always difficult.

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,020
One raw spring roll.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,060
I want to order this.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,660
Did you choose this?

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,980
Fried raw spring rolls.

26
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,300
Without this.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,380
Thai omelet.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,480
Do you want to eat this for one meal?

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,400
Then I'll have dessert later.

30
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,860
Do you want to eat it?

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,160
What should I choose?

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,840
What do you want to eat today?

33
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,520
It's my first time.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,660
If I was alone, I wouldn't have eaten it.

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,340
What should I do?

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,900
What should I do?

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,140
What should I do?

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,600
There are a lot of drinks I've never seen before.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm going to try to get a stable drink.

40
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,520
It's a stable mango.

41
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,560
If I was alone, I wouldn't have ordered it.

42
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,700
I thought I had to do YouTube.

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,160
I ordered it with the spirit of a YouTuber.

44
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,280
It's delicious because it's sold in the store.

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,740
I usually start the video when I eat.

46
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,020
I was waiting for this time.

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,540
I checked the contents of the bag.

48
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,120
It's a letter set.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,220
I'm into writing letters these days.

50
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm writing.

51
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,720
I got a number.

52
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,360
I used to shoot with a tripod.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,060
I couldn't get a picture of my hand.

54
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,160
I bought a tripod.

55
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,560
Thai omelet.

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,720
There's a bag on top.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,320
There's a sauce on top.

58
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,160
It's very delicious.

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,080
A little spicy sauce and omelet.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,380
It has a lot of soup.

61
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,000
It's thin, but it tastes good.

62
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,140
It was delicious.

63
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,620
This is fried raw spring rolls.

64
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,440
I ate it with soy sauce.

65
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,840
I ate it with soy sauce.

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,460
The outside is chewy.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,860
The inside is similar to gyoza.

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,340
It was very delicious.

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,600
I have a very small mouth.

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,720
I eat a lot.

71
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,100
Fried raw spring rolls.

72
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,520
I felt a foreign country.

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,780
I don't know where I'm feeling it.

74
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,880
It was delicious with a taste that wasn't in Japan.

75
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,020
It's a Japanese-style mango.

76
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,700
It's finally here.

77
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,840
Fried raw spring rolls.

78
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,840
I've never eaten it before.

79
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,780
I was scared at first.

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,000
I said it was crispy, but it was okay.

81
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,260
I was worried.

82
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
It's very delicious.

83
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,760
It was delicious.

84
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,340
I was surprised.

85
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,040
The tip of the feet is crispy.

86
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,520
The part of the calf is like chicken.

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,460
It's more elastic than chicken.

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
It's like chicken.

89
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,800
It's delicious.

90
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,720
I was surprised.

91
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,000
The story changes completely.

92
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,240
At the beginning of this year, I went on a trip to Vietnam with Ioki Mao.

93
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,260
When I went to a place I didn't know, there were a lot of dishes I didn't know.

94
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,440
I met a lot of food.

95
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,600
I tried to put it in my mouth without fear.

96
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,780
I met a lot of delicious food.

97
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,980
I was happy.

98
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,560
I want to know a lot of food and go to a lot of countries.

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,580
Please tell me if there is a place that says it was delicious in this country.

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,420
I'm eating the potato I just got from Amane.

101
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,140
Tom Yum's potato.

102
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,960
I dropped the sauce.

103
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,120
I dropped the sauce.

104
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,960
It's like mango.

105
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm pouring everything in.

106
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,640
I think I'm getting full.

107
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,460
I'm Hiroha.

108
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,680
I dropped the sauce.

109
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,540
I was wondering what was in the sauce.

110
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,460
I was researching.

111
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,620
I took a picture about a month ago.

112
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,680
I forgot what was in the sauce.

113
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,260
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,120
I think I'm done.

115
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,680
There was a lot of garbage around my mouth.

116
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,780
I couldn't get it off.

117
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,200
I looked at it and it was a mole.

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,460
How was it?

119
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,940
Please understand your own mole.

120
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,900
I came to a Thai restaurant this time.

121
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,700
I really like foreign food.

122
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,160
What is your favorite food?

123
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
I don't know.

124
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,780
When I choose a restaurant, I usually choose foreign food.

125
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,960
I want to eat food from other countries that I haven't eaten before.

126
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,480
I hope this project will continue if it is popular.

127
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,900
I'm full.

128
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,940
I thought I was going to get another meal.

129
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,620
I thought I was hungry.

130
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,660
I ordered everything.

131
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,200
My favorite food.

132
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,420
Fried banana.

133
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,560
I finally ordered dessert.

134
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,780
My favorite food is last spurt.

135
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,560
I always get sleepy when I eat.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm not good at fighting.

137
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,920
I ate all the vegetables.

138
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,120
I ate all the vegetables.

139
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,900
Mango lassi and last spurt.

140
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,580
Even if you read it from above, it's cute.

141
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,460
Even if you read it from below, it's cute.

142
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,220
I like cameras.

143
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,900
I always put only one photo in this camera.

144
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:49,580
I took a picture of Mt. Fuji from the Shinkansen.

145
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,940
I look so sorry.

146
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,660
Finally, the fried banana is here.

147
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,080
I made it like this.

148
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,820
I made it like this.

149
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,620
I put ice cream in the middle.

150
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,940
It's very delicious.

151
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,660
The outside is crispy.

152
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,980
The inside is hot.

153
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,340
There is a banana in it.

154
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,260
It goes well with ice cream.

155
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,640
It's so delicious that I miss it.

156
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,340
I want to eat it again.

157
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
I want to make it.

158
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,520
I want to make one banana at home.

159
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,220
It looks difficult.

160
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,880
It was really delicious.

161
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:58,680
However, as I said earlier, this is a cat's tongue.

162
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,840
I eat both.

163
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,340
I eat both.

164
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,160
It's hot and cold.

165
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,480
I ate while suffering.

166
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,000
After suffering, I realized that I could get something delicious and beautiful.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,580
The video is coming to an end soon.

168
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,300
I sent you a video like this.

169
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,220
If you are interested, please come to the talk app in the morning.

170
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
Thank you for the meal.

171
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,640
See you.
