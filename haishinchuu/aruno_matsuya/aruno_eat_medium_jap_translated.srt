1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
It's shining, you can see it ahead

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,760
The suit has a strong garlic flavor

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,720
Good morning everyone, I'm Aruno Nakanishi

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,440
It's currently 10 a.m. I am

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:28,720
I came to Matsuya for breakfast. I truly love Matsuya from the bottom of my heart

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,360
Today, unbelievably, this has become a YouTube project

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,120
I've arrived at Matsuya

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,480
Ta-da! I order a lot for delivery

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,360
I come alone, and I always get takeout too

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,200
Thank you! Now, let's get started

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:06,320
From here, I'll deliver with a voiceover. I entered Matsuya

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:15,840
The great thing about Matsuya, first, is that you can order with a touch panel

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,440
It's a very friendly way to order, especially for people like me who aren't good at communicating with staff

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,240
It's a very kind ordering method, and it really helps me

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,840
Since I'm recording this at 10 a.m., I'm really into the breakfast set

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,560
Matsuya's breakfast set is really delicious. It tastes like mom's cooking

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,800
It tastes like the breakfast my mom makes. But in the end, it's limited time only

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,880
I came today to eat this

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:03,520
I chose the tomato hamburger with stewed cabbage. I don't usually eat vegetables, so I don't pick set meals

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,440
I'll eat the set that comes with miso soup and rice

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:22,640
When this product came out, it was a hot topic because it looked like "Umatoma," so I was really looking forward to it

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:32,240
Since the day this job was decided, I've been holding back from eating it, so I was really excited

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Total 880 yen, a great price. In Tokyo these days, a set meal easily goes over 1000 yen

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm grateful. Heading to the seat in the back

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,760
I'm drinking a lot of water

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,920
But since it's this time of day, many people are ordering breakfast sets

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,440
Thank you

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,800
Wait, it's here

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,920
It smells strongly of garlic

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,600
With just one bite, I'm in the "Umatoma" mood

31
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,960
I truly love "Umatoma" from the bottom of my heart

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:48,720
If it's my peers, Teresa Ikeda, Hina Okamoto, and I introduced it, and they got hooked

33
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,640
Iroha Okuda, and Miku Ichinose, who said she likes garlic, might join the "Umatoma" club

34
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm trying to recruit her now

35
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,800
Now, the fan group is split among the 5th generation

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm working as the leading member in Nogizaka

37
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,520
It's so good, I'm shaking. Delicious

38
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,040
This is

39
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,440
Even though it's such a creamy color, it's packed with garlic. Morning

40
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,800
From 10 a.m., I consumed a lot of garlic

41
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
This is

42
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:51,680
About 80% "Umatoma." I feel a very mellow and mild "Umatoma"

43
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,280
I forgot to show everyone. Ta-da! I already took a bite

44
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm not used to this, so I forgot to take a picture when it arrived

45
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,800
It's a rice show

46
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
I didn't order vegetables

47
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Ah, I'm getting hungry

48
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,200
It's shining, it looks like a jewel

49
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,640
Matsuya's wonderful proof, it looked like a shining jewel

50
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Delicious

51
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,320
Matsuya's side dishes are really

52
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,600
Rather salty, with a strong flavor

53
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,560
It's the kind that goes well with rice, a rich taste, and Matsuya's hamburger is really

54
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,240
Meaty, packed with meat

55
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,200
This product is definitely inspired by "Umatoma" from the Kazuki site

56
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,080
It's probably intentional, the introduction text is very promising

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,240
It's delicious, I might call the chef

58
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,240
The first time I ate "Umatoma," I almost stood up to call the chef

59
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm not lying

60
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,240
The miso soup is strong

61
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
It tastes like grandma's miso soup

62
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
I want to see you

63
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I want to see grandma

64
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Another great thing about Matsuya, when you order a hamburger, you get a spoon

65
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,240
It's not cut with a fork and knife, it's a bit masculine

66
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,240
I really like it. I wonder if Matsuya has forks and knives

67
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,240
I might not know

68
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Almost all the rice is gone. I eat pretty fast

69
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
I'm really quick, so

70
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Quick entry, quick exit. I always head to Matsuya

71
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,240
If I had 30 minutes, I'd have plenty of time

72
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,240
I can finish quickly, so during work breaks

73
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,240
I sometimes drop by during work breaks

74
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:04,240
It's great that there are so many stores in Tokyo

75
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,240
For some reason, I want the tea with Matsuya's robot at home

76
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,240
It feels warm

77
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Like a mother

78
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,240
By the way, I have something to reflect on

79
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
This

80
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,240
After eating the stewed cabbage tomato hamburger, I said it was a mellow "Umatoma"

81
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,240
in my food report

82
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,240
But for people who haven't eaten "Umatoma," they wouldn't understand

83
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Comparing food to food, I did something taboo and I'm reflecting on it

84
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:59,240
It's a mellow but punchy hamburger with garlic from Matsuya

85
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Probably, even when this video is released, another tomato dish will be out

86
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,240
But they never release "Umatoma" hamburger

87
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,240
I feel Matsuya's pride in that

88
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,240
"Umatoma" is a rare character that appears only once a year, and that's what makes it special

89
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,240
In the end, I keep eating things similar to "Umatoma," but

90
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I always come back to the original "Umatoma"

91
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Yeah

92
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Ta-da! Finished eating

93
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm full. It's been a while since I ate this much at 7:30

94
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I ate a lot

95
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Thank you

96
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
It was delicious, I'm full

97
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm totally satisfied. After I get home

98
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
I'll just sleep
