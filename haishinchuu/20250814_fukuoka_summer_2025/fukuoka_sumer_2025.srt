1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
The food is here!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,680
Delicious!

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,260
Delicious!

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,380
This is the best!

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,800
I want to eat a lot of them!

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,380
Cute!

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,760
I'm going to eat a lot today!

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,460
What is the next destination?

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,360
The summer nationwide tour 2025

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,900
PR Operation in...

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,980
Fukuoka!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,940
The three of us are now in Fukuoka

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,780
What you can see behind us is...

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,900
The venue where we will perform

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,360
Marine Messe Fukuoka

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,120
It's amazing!

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,980
It's my first time seeing it from the outside

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,340
It's a strange shape

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,260
It's like a wave

20
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,520
It's ringing

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,080
And now we are...

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,860
We are on the ship!

23
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,860
It's shaking!

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,700
It's shaking!

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,780
It's shaking!

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,460
It's fun and feels good

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:23,180
We will perform in Fukuoka this time

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,260
It's famous in Fukuoka

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I've never been on it before

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,040
So I wanted to try it

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,200
That's why I'm on it this time

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,260
Please go to the place where you are going

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,800
Is it called the sacred place?

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,020
Please enjoy the live performance

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,800
And enjoy Fukuoka

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,880
Let's enjoy it!

37
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,640
We are on the cruise

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,120
It's sudden

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,220
I have a recommendation for Fukuoka

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,080
Can I introduce it?

41
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,120
Of course!

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,500
Ta-da!

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,820
It's Kurowasu from Mikazuki

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,540
Kurowasu?

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,600
Yes, it's Kurowasu

46
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,700
I still buy it when I go back to Fukuoka

47
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,760
I always buy it

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,060
I always eat it before I go to Nogizaka

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,960
It has a lot of flavors

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,780
So I want to eat it for breakfast

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,420
Let's eat

52
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,780
What flavor do you like?

53
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,940
What flavor do you like?

54
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,720
Black tea, soybean flour, and flan

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
By the way, I recommend soybean flour

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,500
I want to eat it because it's a recommendation

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,600
Can you eat it?

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,900
I can eat it

59
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,180
It looks delicious

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,580
Be careful not to spill it

61
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,040
Amazing

62
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,720
I recommend it to everyone

63
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,900
Please try it

64
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,100
It looks delicious

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,380
Let's eat

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,360
Let's eat

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,260
I can feel the soybean flour

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,040
It's delicious

69
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,560
I can feel the soybean flour

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,660
It's a simple Kurowasu

71
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,200
Yes, it's simple

72
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,580
It's delicious

73
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,980
It's delicious

74
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,880
It's been a long time

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,520
Let's eat

76
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,640
It's delicious

77
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,740
It's delicious

78
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,540
It's delicious

79
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,060
It's delicious

80
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,460
Is there something in it?

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,800
There is soybean flour in it

82
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,100
Really?

83
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,460
It's delicious

84
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,900
What's wrong?

85
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,640
Soybean flour is in it

86
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,300
Be careful

87
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,280
Please try it

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
It's delicious

89
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,060
Did you come here often when you lived in Fukuoka?

90
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,480
I went to a shopping mall called Canal City

91
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,980
Do you know?

92
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,940
I've been there

93
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,840
I went to a shopping mall called Canal City

94
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,480
Really?

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,660
I went on a school trip

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
School trip?

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,180
In Fukuoka?

98
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,120
That's right

99
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,720
I saw the theater ceremony in Fukuoka

100
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,560
Did you see it?

101
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,320
I'm happy

102
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,860
I went to Fukuoka often

103
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,980
I'm happy

104
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,560
I didn't expect it

105
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,520
Oh, no

106
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,720
It's all over the place

107
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,140
It's all over the place

108
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,540
It's all over the place

109
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,900
It's cute

110
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,180
It's cute

111
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,880
Mitsuki often spills

112
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,160
Really?

113
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,540
Does it look like an older sister?

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,460
It spills unexpectedly

115
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,340
I often see it spilling

116
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:16,920
It's cute

117
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,960
It spills a lot

118
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,100
It's cute

119
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,260
It spills

120
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,580
It's so cute

121
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,080
There is a live performance on August 9th and 10th in Fukuoka

122
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,620
Please put it on as an announcement

123
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,420
I'll put it on later

124
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you

125
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,160
I moved to another place

126
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,060
I'm in Iwataya now

127
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,140
Here is my favorite

128
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,220
Mentai France bread

129
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,480
There is Fukutaro

130
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm going to go there now

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,420
I'm looking forward to it

132
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,200
Let's go

133
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,560
I can see it

134
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,480
It says ME

135
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,060
It says ME

136
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm happy

137
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,080
It looks delicious

138
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,400
By the way, my recommendation is

139
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,640
Rich cheese

140
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,140
It must be delicious

141
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,700
This is very delicious

142
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,960
I'm not sure about this

143
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
I'll go with rich cheese

144
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,920
How is the plain one?

145
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,320
It's delicious

146
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,880
I've eaten this before

147
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,780
Rich plain

148
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,320
Mentai

149
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,500
It's full

150
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,180
It was delicious

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,320
What should I do?

152
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm confused

153
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,320
How is it?

154
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm curious about the cheese

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,740
I'm curious about the cheese

156
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,900
I recommend the cheese

157
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,700
What do you think?

158
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,120
Please give me some advice

159
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,680
If you like simple food, I recommend the plain one

160
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,800
If you want to try something you haven't eaten before, I recommend the cheese

161
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,860
I'll go with the plain one

162
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,620
The plain one is good

163
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,240
Excuse me

164
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,380
I'll have two rich cheese and one plain

165
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,800
Thank you

166
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Thank you

167
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,620
What is this?

168
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,340
How many can I put in one?

169
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,640
I think I can do it

170
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,040
I think I can do it

171
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,440
I'll start with the cheese

172
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,980
I think I can do it

173
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,340
Thank you

174
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,880
How long does it take?

175
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,580
About 4 to 6 minutes

176
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,440
Okay

177
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,080
It's lined up

178
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,780
Do you usually warm it up here?

179
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,100
This is my first time to eat in

180
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,720
There is a freezer at the back of the house

181
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,500
I definitely bake it in the oven toaster when I come back

182
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,340
It's amazing

183
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,460
It's a continuation of bread

184
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,040
I'm sorry

185
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,380
I didn't think about anything

186
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,040
Why?

187
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,720
I put out a lot of my favorite bread

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,140
I'm sorry

189
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,420
Are the eyes of menbe?

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
I think so

191
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,860
The eyes of menbe are the same

192
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Wait, isn't that right?

193
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,840
Menbe is in the back

194
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,760
Is it Mr. Kutaro?

195
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,500
The eyes of menbe

196
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,620
I've seen menbe before

197
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,180
It was the same eyes

198
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,900
The same eyes

199
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,240
I just found out

200
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,040
I love menbe

201
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,940
I love mentaiko

202
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,420
Wait

203
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,580
It seems to be 1 to 1.5 minutes

204
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,960
Is it burnt?

205
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,040
Is it okay?

206
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,680
It looks good

207
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,240
Thank you

208
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,420
It looks delicious

209
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,820
It looks delicious

210
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,780
Please try it first

211
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,440
Is it okay?

212
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
Can I eat this?

213
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,820
Of course

214
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,240
Let's eat

215
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,640
Let's eat

216
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,180
It's delicious

217
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,920
It's cute

218
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,660
It's delicious

219
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,440
It's a guilty lobster

220
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,180
It's very delicious

221
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,580
There is something inside

222
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,040
There is something inside

223
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,860
There is cheese that melts

224
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,000
It's delicious

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,720
Let's eat

226
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,280
It's delicious

227
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,780
It's delicious

228
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,820
It's very delicious

229
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,000
It's very delicious

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,660
It's very delicious

231
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,560
I want you to eat cheese because it melts

232
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,220
Really?

233
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,260
It's very delicious

234
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,140
Let's eat

235
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,160
It's delicious

236
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,600
It's delicious

237
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,100
It's delicious

238
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,620
It's delicious

239
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,640
It's delicious

240
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,400
I've never eaten mentaiko bread

241
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,220
Really?

242
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,060
I ate it for the first time

243
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,900
It's delicious

244
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,480
If you eat it for the first time, you won't be able to eat anything else

245
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,840
That's true

246
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,940
Let's eat a lot of delicious food

247
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,680
There is a tour

248
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,660
Let's eat a lot

249
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,640
Nagizaka 46 will have a live performance in Fukuoka on August 9th and 10th

250
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,060
I would be happy if you could participate

251
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,980
Thank you

252
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,180
Thank you

253
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,340
We have moved to Fukuoka

254
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,060
Speaking of Fukuoka

255
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,880
Mizutaki

256
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,500
It's a great place

257
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,560
We came to my favorite mizutaki restaurant

258
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,880
It's amazing

259
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,040
It's my first time going to this restaurant

260
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,220
I've been to other restaurants before

261
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,320
It was very delicious

262
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,140
Let's eat mizutaki together today

263
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,400
Let's go

264
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,380
We arrived at the seat

265
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,320
Today is a trip to eat

266
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,200
We've been here for a long time

267
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,940
How is your stomach?

268
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,300
It feels good, but the mizutaki part is empty

269
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,980
I'm glad

270
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,160
The mizutaki part is empty

271
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,880
Is it empty?

272
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,820
I also eat mizutaki

273
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
I'm glad

274
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,860
Everything that Miku-chan recommended was delicious

275
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,620
Really?

276
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,620
I'm glad

277
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,380
There are many dishes that suit your taste

278
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,020
This combination is not available

279
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,100
I was very nervous

280
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,780
I'm nervous too

281
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,800
It's here

282
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
It's amazing

283
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,040
It smells

284
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,860
The smell of the soup stock

285
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,040
It's an egg

286
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,420
It's shiny

287
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,260
Amazing

288
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,260
I will explain the dishes

289
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,500
This is a half-boiled egg

290
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,540
Please cut it from the middle

291
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,280
Please eat with mizutaki

292
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,720
Please open the dish

293
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,680
Thank you

294
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,940
There are seasonal ingredients

295
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,220
Fukuoka okura and myoga

296
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,180
It looks delicious

297
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,160

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,600
I really like okura

300
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,820
Okura is delicious

301
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,120
I like okura

302
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
Did you say bainiku?

303
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,980
Bainiku?

304
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,080
Ume

305
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,180
I like ume

306
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,260
I'm looking forward to it

307
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,180
I feel like a girlfriend no matter where I take it

308
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,900
My eyes are open

309
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,220
I will eat the egg

310
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,380
Please eat

311
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,320
I'm nervous

312
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,820
I'm nervous while watching

313
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,280
I'm watching

314
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm talking

315
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,320
It's delicious

316
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,640
Delicious

317
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,700
Meat miso

318
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,320
It's sweet

319
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
It's sweet

320
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,300

I'm happy

324
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,840

I'm sorry

336
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,720
I'm sorry

337
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,260
I'm sorry

338
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,380
I thought it was my sister

339
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,140
I'm glad to see that it looks like a child

340
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,680
First, please drink the soup as it is.

341
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,300
Thank you.

342
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,160
First, please close your eyes and drink the soup as it is.

343
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,420
It's hot, so please move to the side.

344
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,340
Close your eyes.

345
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,840
Itadakimasu.

346
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,160
It's hot.

347
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,320
It's delicious.

348
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,440
It's delicious.

349
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,360
After drinking the soup,

350
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
we will prepare more ingredients.

351
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,080
Salt is the best salt in Itoshima City.

352
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,400
It's rich in minerals and has a strong umami.

353
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,860
What is salt?

354
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,940
It's a kind of chopsticks.

355
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,920
That's right.

356
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,140
Have you ever eaten Mitsutake?

357
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,120
Only once.

358
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,120
I have eaten Mitsutake in Fukuoka.

359
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,560
In Fukuoka?

360
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,140
Yes.

361
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,200
When?

362
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,260
I went to see Mr. Yoda's graduation concert.

363
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,120
I ate Mitsutake in Fukuoka on my way home.

364
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,460
Yuki came to Fukuoka with Yoda for two days.

365
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,960
I was glad to eat delicious food.

366
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,140
I ate Mitsutake with everyone. It was very delicious.

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Next is meat and green onion shabu-shabu.

368
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,900
This is Hakata's all-purpose green onion.

369
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,680
It is boiled quickly.

370
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,700
This is meat.

371
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,520
This is from Kumamoto prefecture.

372
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,640
This is fresh meat.

373
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,280
This contains three types of breast, thigh, and bone.

374
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,260
This is homemade all-purpose ponzu sauce.

375
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,440
Please pour it little by little.

376
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,320
Thank you very much.

377
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,660
I will pour the ponzu sauce.

378
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,660
The color is different.

379
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,180
Thank you very much.

380
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,520
I will eat Mitsutake shabu-shabu.

381
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,780
Is it delicious?

382
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,840
It's the best.

383
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,420
It's soft.

384
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,640
Did you eat it?

385
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,480
I ate green onion.

386
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,460
I like green onion very much.

387
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,550
Me too.

388
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,080
I like green onion very much.

389
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,540
It's very delicious.

390
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,100
Please eat it.

391
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,300
I will eat it.

392
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,240
I will eat it.

393
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,180
It's delicious.

394
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,240
This is the best.

395
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,540
It's delicious and sweet.

396
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,000
This is Mitsuki's first tour.

397
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,500
How is it?

398
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,480
It's very fun.

399
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,180
Is it fun?

400
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,720
The food is different from the local food.

401
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,840
I'm looking forward to it.

402
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,800
I'm glad.

403
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,720
Do you remember your first tour?

404
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,540
I remember it.

405
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,300
I was very nervous.

406
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
I was very nervous.

407
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm glad that I'm enjoying it.

408
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,100
I was very nervous at first.

409
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,120
I was very nervous at the beginning.

410
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,700
As time went by, I was more and more excited.

411
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,340
Are you happy?

412
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm looking forward to the new rock band.

413
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,920
I watched the rehearsal with Sakura for the first time.

414
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,420
Everyone is cute.

415
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,840
Everyone is cute.

416
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,420
Miku was imitating the last pose.

417
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm very happy.

418
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,540
Everyone is cute.

419
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,980
This is the last pose.

420
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,200
Is this pose meaningful?

421
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,240
Is this the 6th generation of rock band?

422
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,440
Is this the 6th generation of rock band?

423
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,200
I don't know.

424
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,720
I don't know what this is.

425
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,560
Please tell me what you noticed.

426
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,500
Please tell me what you noticed.

427
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,860
I thought you noticed.

428
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,680
I didn't notice it.

429
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,560
That's the 6th generation of rock band.

430
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,860
There are a lot of rock bands in there.

431
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,920
That's true.

432
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,620
I'm happy.

433
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,380
Do Mitsuki and Miku usually talk?

434
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,320
I don't have a machine.

435
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,820
I didn't notice it.

436
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,860
I didn't notice it.

437
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,140
I'm happy today.

438
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,500
I'm still nervous.

439
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,140
Do you two talk?

440
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,980
We used to do it together.

441
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,960
I have a chance to be with you.

442
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,520
I'm a good talker.

443
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,520
I'm a good talker.

444
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
Did you go to a restaurant with your seniors?

445
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,200
I didn't go.

446
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,520
We're good friends.

447
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,780
We went to a restaurant for the second time.

448
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,900
We went to a restaurant for the second time.

449
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,760
We talked a lot.

450
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,620
I'm not good at talking.

451
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,240
I can't appeal to you.

452
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,680
Let's go next time.

453
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,160
What do you like?

454
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,980
I like anything.

455
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,120
Let's go somewhere together.

456
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,880
You haven't been out in the summer, have you?

457
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,480
You keep saying that.

458
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,600
Why do you know that?

459
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,300
It's always like that.

460
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,240
Let's go together next time.

461
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,580
Let's go.

462
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,380
You said it.

463
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,500
I'll invite you.

464
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,460
Will you really invite me?

465
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,560
Will you come if I invite you?

466
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,400
It's suspicious.

467
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,440
I'll go with you.

468
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,740
Let's go together.

469
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,460
Let's eat something that feels like summer.

470
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,340
I want to go.

471
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,040
It looks fun.

472
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,740
Please put your hands together.

473
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,580
Thank you for the meal.

474
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,820
Thank you for the meal.

475
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,540
We ate a lot of delicious food in Fukuoka.

476
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,000
It's over safely.

477
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,040
How was your day?

478
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,980
It was a short time.

479
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,440
I was able to enjoy Fukuoka.

480
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,680
I was able to eat delicious food that made me full.

481
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm very satisfied.

482
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,120
That's good.

483
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,640
How was it?

484
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,040
Fukuoka was full of food.

485
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,900
It was delicious.

486
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,300
I'm looking forward to Fukuoka on the day of the concert.

487
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,620
Don't spill it in Fukuoka.

488
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,980
Be careful.

489
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,880
It was a rare three people.

490
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,900
They were cute and fun.

491
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,020
I was satisfied with my stomach and heart.

492
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,840
We are planning to have a concert in Sendai tomorrow.

493
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,360
We are in a hurry from now on.

494
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:36,960
We are in a hurry.

495
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,820
We will eat a lot of beef tongue tomorrow.

496
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,140
We will eat a lot.

497
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,220

500
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,380
Can I have this poster?

501
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,240
Yes, please.

502
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,280
